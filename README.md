# ChatroomWithoutSocket
Clients keep polling the server in a given interval.   
Tons of bugs right now -.-  
Things to do:  
1.Scroll to bottom when sending/receiving messages.  
2.Fit long messages into wrapper box. Messages not wrapping right now.   
3.Mark self messages with special style.  
4.Fix editing box overlapping with messages.

## To run in nodejs: 
npm install  
node server
